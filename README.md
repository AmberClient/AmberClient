### How to use Amber Client

1. Install [Fabric 1.21.4](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/gqdThinky/AmberClient/releases/tag/Beta) and put the .jar in your mods folder (usually in %appdata%/.minecraft/mods)
3. Install [Fabric API for 1.21.4](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions) & [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin/version/1.10.8+kotlin.1.9.0) (at least 1.10.8+kotlin.1.9.0)
4. Put both of them in your mods folder (the same where the Amber Client jar is)
5. Run Minecraft!
